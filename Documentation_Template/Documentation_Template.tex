where latitude and longitude are preferably in fraction of degrees (a
decimal number), not sexagesimal, and where north latitude is positive
(south is negative) and east longitude is positive (west is
negative).{]}}\\

is needed (e.g.~file by file) this section can be moved to Data and File
overview.{]}}

3) Was data derived from another source?\\
\emph{{[}Answer Yes or No. If Yes, list source(s).{]}}\\

publication unless you have made sure that you can do that. Some
journals may consider this as a publication, and will not accept a
manuscript with a section that has already been published.{]}}\\
\emph{{[}If you want to refer to an article that has not been accepted
for publication yet, include as much information as you have at the
moment (e.g.~authors and title). If the publication has been published
