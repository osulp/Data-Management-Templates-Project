CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
-------------------

1. Abstract for the dataset 
[The abstract should describe the dataset, not the research or the results obtained after analyzing the dataset. The dataset abstract should be different than an article or book abstract, even if the dataset is tightly related to the article or book.]



2. Context of the research project that this dataset was collected for.
[Any contextual information that will help to interpret the dataset. You can give details about the research questions that prompted the collection of this dataset. ]


3. Date of data collection:
[single date or range or approximate date in format YYYY-MM-DD]

4. Geographic location of data collection:
[Location of the data collection.]
[If you include coordinates use format: "latitude, longitude" where latitude and longitude are preferably in fraction of degrees (a decimal number), not sexagesimal, and where north latitude is positive (south is negative) and east longitude is positive (west is negative).]
[If you include a Bounding box indicate Label, Latitude North, Latitude South, Longitude West, Longitude East]



5. Funding sources that supported the collection of the data:
[Include agency and grant number if applicable]

3. Links to other publicly accessible locations of the data:


4. Recommended citation for the data:
[Doe, J. & Smith, J. (2018) Title of this wonderful dataset [Data set]. Oregon State University. https://doi.org/10.7267/doid01DOI ]


5. Dataset Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
[Information to add at the end of the submission process, after dataset review.]

[Describe any known problems or caveats that would limit reuse of the data.]


--------------------------
VERSIONING AND PROVENANCE
-------------------------- 

1. Last modification date
[Date dataset was last modified in format YYYY-MM-DD]


2. Links/relationships to other versions of this dataset:
[If there are previous versions explain where the other version is, when it was updated, and summarize the changes.]
[If a very granular description of the versions of the dataset is needed (e.g. file by file) this section can be moved to Data and File overview.]


3. Was data derived from another source?
[Answer Yes or No. If Yes, list source(s).]
[If there is code in the dataset, and the code is in a repository explain how this snapshot of the code is tagged in the repository]


4. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package:


--------------------------
METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------
[Describe the methodology used to generate the dataset]
[Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing methodological information]
[Do not copy paste the methods section from a pending publication unless you have made sure that you can do that. Some journals may consider this as a publication, and will not accept a manuscript with a section that has already been published.]
[If you want to refer to an article that has not been accepted for publication yet, include as much information as you have at the moment (e.g. authors and title). If the publication has been published include the DOI in the citation. If the publication does not have a DOI (like a dissertation) include a URL.]



1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
[experimental design or protocols used in data collection]

2. Methods for processing the data: 
[describe how the submitted data were generated from the raw or collected data]


3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:
[If software is needed to interpret the data, explain where to get the software. If software is not openly available include it in the dataset (if possible). If including the software is not possible consider changing the format of the dataset. Include version of software. ]
