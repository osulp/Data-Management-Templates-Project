## Info
The Data Management Templates Project is a compilation of templates that can be used at different stages of the research project to maximize best practices in data management. The templates were created for Oregon State University but are generic and should be suitable for any discipline or institution. They are published under a CC0 license so that they can be modified as needed. We also give you guidance on how to fill out the templates, examples of completed documents and instructions for publishing your documents on Github Pages.  

## Templates
Included in the project are the following data management document templates:

### 1. Data Management Implementation Plan  
This template will help researchers take a Data Management Plan created in the proposal stages of a grant, and implement it. The goal is that this document will have specific guidelines to help the researchers in the project to manage data in a coordinated manner. This should be a living document that can be updated during the project as needed. Hosting this template in GitHub is a good way of keeping track of the modifications in this document.  
**View The Template**: [Implementation Plan Template](Implementation_Template/Implementation_Template.md)  

**Download The Template** : *For more information on how to download files from our repository go [here](github_instructions.md#how-to-download-the-template-files).*  
The template is available in the following formats:  
[Markdown](https://github.com/osulp/Data-Management-Templates-Project/blob/master/Implementation_Template/Implementation_Template.md) | [Word Document](https://github.com/osulp/Data-Management-Templates-Project/blob/master/Implementation_Template/Implementation_Template.docs) | [LaTeX](https://github.com/osulp/Data-Management-Templates-Project/blob/master/Implementation_Template/Implementation_Template.tex)  

**Example** : A fictional example that shows what this document could look like for a specific research project.

### 2. Internal Data Sharing Plan

Disagreements between the members of a team regarding the sharing of research data during the project is a common occurrence. This Internal Data Sharing Plan is designed so that researchers will make decisions about data sharing and data attribution at the beginning of the project, to minimize disagreements down the road. This document makes sure everyone has the information they need to decide when and how to share data internally during the development of the research.

### 3. Documentation File

A Documentation File (sometimes referred to as README file)  has information about datasets that are made publicly available in data repositories. This document ensures that others have all the information they need to understand and potentially reuse the data, it identifies the authors of the dataset so that they can be contacted if needed, and clarify the terms of use of the data.
