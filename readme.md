#Data Management Templates Project

In this repository you will find templates that will help you understand and create several data management documents. We have provided boiler plate templates and full completed examples for each of the three templates we provide. This projects help you create the following three documents:
* Data Management Implementation Plan
* Data Internal Sharing Plan
* Data Documentation File (README)

## Context of the project

We provide templates, instructions with tools and resources, and examples to make these documents as easy as possible to generate.
